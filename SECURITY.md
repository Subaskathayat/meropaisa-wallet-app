## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it responsibly:

1. **Do NOT** create a public issue
2. Email security concerns to: [security@example.com]
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow time for the issue to be addressed before public disclosure

## Security Measures Implemented

### üîê Authentication & Authorization
- **Multi-factor Authentication**: Biometric + PIN fallback
- **Firebase Authentication**: Secure user management
- **Session Management**: Secure token handling
- **Phone Number Verification**: OTP-based authentication

### üõ°Ô∏è Data Protection
- **Firebase Security Rules**: Server-side data protection
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Encrypted Storage**: Sensitive data encrypted at rest
- **Secure Transmission**: All data transmitted over HTTPS

### üîí Application Security
- **Firebase App Check**: Additional security layer for API calls
- **Biometric Authentication**: Hardware-backed security
- **Transaction Verification**: Multi-layer transaction authentication
- **Balance Verification**: Atomic transaction processing

### üì± Mobile Security
- **Certificate Pinning**: Protection against man-in-the-middle attacks
- **Root/Jailbreak Detection**: Enhanced security on compromised devices
- **Screen Recording Protection**: Sensitive screens protected
- **App Backgrounding**: Sensitive data hidden when app is backgrounded

## Configuration Security

### Firebase Configuration
- All sensitive Firebase configuration has been removed from this repository
- Placeholder values are used in `lib/firebase_options.dart`
- Real configuration files are excluded via `.gitignore`

### API Keys & Secrets
- No hardcoded API keys or secrets in the codebase
- Environment variables recommended for configuration
- Secure key management practices enforced

### Build Security
- Debug builds only - production builds require additional security measures
- Obfuscation recommended for production releases
- Code signing required for app store distribution

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Security
1. **Never commit sensitive data** (API keys, passwords, certificates)
2. **Validate all inputs** before processing
3. **Use parameterized queries** for database operations
4. **Implement proper error handling** without exposing sensitive information
5. **Follow secure coding practices** for mobile development

### Testing Security
1. **Test authentication flows** thoroughly
2. **Verify authorization checks** for all operations
3. **Test input validation** with malicious inputs
4. **Check for data leakage** in logs and error messages
5. **Verify secure storage** implementation

### Deployment Security
1. **Use secure build environments**
2. **Implement code signing** for releases
3. **Configure proper security rules** in Firebase
4. **Enable monitoring and alerting** for security events
5. **Regular security audits** and updates

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations
- This is a demonstration app with simulated payment features
- Real payment integration would require additional security measures
- Production deployment requires comprehensive security audit
- Compliance with financial regulations not implemented

### Recommended Enhancements for Production
1. **PCI DSS Compliance** for payment processing
2. **Advanced Fraud Detection** systems
3. **Real-time Security Monitoring** and alerting
4. **Regular Penetration Testing** and security audits
5. **Compliance with Local Financial Regulations**

## Security Updates

This project follows responsible disclosure practices:
- Security updates are prioritized
- Critical vulnerabilities are patched immediately
- Security advisories are published for significant issues
- Regular dependency updates to address known vulnerabilities

## Compliance

### Data Privacy
- GDPR compliance considerations implemented
- User data minimization practices
- Clear data retention policies
- User consent management

### Financial Regulations
- KYC/AML considerations for production use
- Transaction monitoring capabilities
- Audit trail maintenance
- Regulatory reporting features
